Medlay[^origin] is a **hybrid media form concept** for crafting a multimedia artefact[^form-artefact] to narrate a story and/or communicate an idea on the Web.

It is hybrid because it combines the strenght[^strength] of two popular media forms, the **cinema** and **comic** ones. In particular, it fuses the one-image-at-a-time **temporal narration** peculiar to cinema with the multi-images **spatial narration** peculiar to comics.

Two [proof of concept prototypes]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/proofs-of-concept.html) have been created to demostrate the possibilities of use of Medlay: ***The Last Dispatch*** and ***Ubik Chap. 6***. They both narrate a short story.

Viewers of a Medlay artefact can **explore actively** and **freely**[^exploration] the time and space of a multimedia narration. 

The **watching time** of a Medlay artefact is not dictated by the roll of moving images as it happens for a movie, so viewers are completely free to interact with the narrative sequence at an **order** and **pace** of their own choosing.

[^origin]: Medlay = *medley* + *lay*.

[^form-artefact]: A **media form** is to a **media artefact** as comics is to a particular comic book or as cinema is to a particular movie: the latter is a specific application of the former.

[^strength]: Such as, for example, the moving image or the variably sized and shaped panel.

[^exploration]: By means of desktop and mobile devices and an up-to-date browser.
