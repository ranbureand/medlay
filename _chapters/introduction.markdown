intro: "A Hybrid Media Form"
---

**Medlay**[^origin] is a **hybrid media form concept** for crafting a **multimedia artefact**[^form-artefact] to narrate a story and/or communicate an idea on the Web.

It is **hybrid** because it combines the strenght[^strength] of two popular media forms, the **cinema** and **comic** ones. In particular, it fuses the one-image-at-a-time **temporal narration** peculiar to cinema with the multi-images **spatial narration** peculiar to comics.

Two **proof of concept prototypes** have been created to explore and test the possibilities of Medlay: ***The Last Dispatch*** and ***Ubik Chap. 6***. They both narrate a short story.

**Viewers** of a Medlay artefact can **explore actively** and **freely**[^exploration] the time and space of a multimedia narration. 

The **watching time** of a Medlay artefact is **not dictated** by the **roll of moving images** as it happens for a movie, so viewers are completely free to interact with the narrative sequence at an **order** and **pace** of their own choosing.




[^origin]: **Medlay** = ***medley*** + ***lay***.

[^form-artefact]: A **media form** is to a **media artefact** as comics is to a particular comic book or as cinema is to a particular movie: the latter is a specific application of the former.

[^strength]: Such as, for example, the **moving image** or the **variably sized** and **shaped panel**.

[^exploration]: By means of desktop and mobile devices and an up-to-date browser.
