A piece is the **basic building block** of a medlay.

It is a **mix**/**hybridization** between the cinematographic shot and the comic panel and, as its precursors, it becomes significant when placed in context with other pieces, that is if it is **spatially juxtaposed in a sequence**[^sequences] of pieces.

### Series of Images into Loop

A piece constitutes of one or more dynamic **series of images**[^shot] sequentially **juxtaposed in time**.

Each piece is **formed into a loop**, which allows for the content represented to be repetitive in time, and thus always accessible to viewers.

### Different Types of Pieces

A piece being formed into a loop entails that the one or more series it is composed of are spliced together.

The **splicing** can be either **continuous**[^continuity-editing], by means of a smooth [transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition "Film Transition in Wikipedia") of time and space, or **discontinuous**, by the lack of it.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Continuous piace vs discontinuous piece." %}

In the case in which a piece constitutes of a sequence of a **single series**, at the end of the piece the last and the first images of the series are spliced together: that is the series[^coincidence] is juxtaposed in time with itself.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Single series." %}

In the case in which a piece constitutes of a sequence of **multiple series**, at the end of the piece the last image of the last series and the first one of the first series are spliced together: that is the last series is juxtaposed in time with the first one.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Multiple series." %}

A **particular case** of multiple series piece is when the piece constitutes of a sequence of two series of images where the second of the twos it is none other than the first one **time reversed** and **played back**.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Multiple series back and forth." %}

### Length of Time

Each series is meant to run for a **short period of time** rather than a long one: the shorter a series is, the shorter the resulting piece is, the shorter the time viewers need **to go through and grasp** it will be.

The length of time of series needs always to be taken into account for the sake of crafting a **quickly digestible piece**, especially in the case the piece is composed by multiple series in sequence.

### Viewer's Interaction

A piece can be programmed to respond to **viewers' interaction** and/or **focus of attention** and thus change from a passive state to an active one if **triggered by an event**[^events].

For **example**, a piece constituted of a single series changes state and passes[^transition] to a second different single series in response to viewers' tapping of the piece or scrolling of the canvas into a certain area of focus.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Multiple series 1-2-1 and 1-2-3 on tap." %}

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Single series 1-2 on canvas scroll." %}

### Frame

Since a piece is spatially juxtaposed on a canvas, its frame is directly visible[^cinematographic-frame] to viewers: frame **size**, **shape** and **borders** become **significant** and can be shaped to express or reinforce the meaning of the piece.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Significant sizes and shapes." %}

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="Significant borders." %}

[^sequences]: More on sequences of pieces in the next chapter, *[Sequences]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapters/sequences.html)*.

[^shot]: What in **cinematographic language** are called **[shots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_%28filmmaking%29 "Shot in Wikipedia")**.

    In this context I prefer using the more generic **term *series***, mainly because the **term *shot*** is too strongly connected to the cinema media form and its mainly photographic footage.

[^continuity-editing]: And here the bag of tricks of [continuity editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_editing "Continuity Editing in Wikipedia") comes into play.

[^coincidence]: The series coincides with the piece itself, since the piece is the series.

[^transition]: The transition can be either a **cut** or a whole new **transitional series**, which plays only once and works mainly as a connector between the starting and finishing state of the piece.

[^events]: On mouse over, on tap, on scroll, ....

[^cinematographic-frame]: Similary to a comic panel and differently from a **cinematographic shot**, which latter frame is fixed sized and shaped and has **transparent**, **non-significant** borders.
