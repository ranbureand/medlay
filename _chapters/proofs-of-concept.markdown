> We wanted to give you a shave like no other you ever had. We said, it's about time a man's face got a little loving. We said, with Ubik's self-winding Swiss chromium never-ending blade, the days of scrape-scrape are over. So try Ubik. And be loved.
> 
> Warning: use only as directed. And with caution.

Ubik Chap. 6 is structured using **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, **jQuery** and **CSS**.
