I was able to work on **Medlay** as my **thesis subject**: such opportunity allowed me to refine its concept while further researching and understanding the way the cinema and comics media form work.

Here follows the main reasoning behind my thesis, which main aim was formulate a new creative way to crossbreed cinema and comics on the Web.

### Remediation

That of the two media of cinema and comics is a long story of competition and reciprocal **remediation**[^remediation].

The term remediation is **not** meant to refer to the **transposition of contents**[^transposition] among cinema and comics but instead to the reciprocal borrowing and reshaping of their media forms carried out by both of them.

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="For example, the 1960s TV series ***Batman*** transposed the imagery and characters of the homonymous comic book." %}

A practical **example of** a **remediation** is the way the movie ***Sin City*** --- which is a transposition of the homonymous graphic novel --- has remediated a typical device of the comics media form, that is the ***splash page***.

> Through "splash pages" [...] comics have the distinctive potential to convey in purely **graphic** terms the **importance** of a (literally) "big" moment in the story.

> <cite>Greg M. Smith, *Shaping The Maxx: adapting the comic book frame to television*</cite>

Restricted by the <quote>film's seemingly fixed, invisible frame</quote> the movie remediates and reshapes the "splash page" device by means of the camera movement and of the artificial frozen pose adopted by the jumping character.

### Digital Revolution

**Before** the **digital revolution** these reciprocal remediations have always been **limited by different production**, **recording**, **transmission** and **reproduction technologies**.

**After** the **digital revolution**, the **technological differences** between the two cultural forms --- taken and included by the World Wide Web --- have been **reset**: in most cases cinema and comics have nonetheless continued to be considered and **remediated separately**.

Is it possible to create a new **hybrid media form** which integrates those characteristics of cinema and comics that seemed incompatible in the past, now that the two media forms potentially differ only in their respective procedures?

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="In my opinion ***Marvel Motion Comics*** are **not comics**: actually their media form is the cartoon cinema one through and through." %}

### Sequential Art

To value the actual possibility of an interbreeding between the two cultural forms, cinema and comics have been subsumed under the more general concept of **sequential art**: <quote>the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea</quote> --- a definition created in 1985 by **Will Eisner**[^source-1] and expanded in 1994 by **Scott McCloud**[^source-2] --- and compared to highlight some of their affinities and some of their differences.

The **comparison** analyzes the following points:

+ the respective procedures with which cinema and comics represent **time** and **space**, both at the level of the cinema shot and that of the comics panel and at the level of the sequence of shots and panels;

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="." %}

+ the differences between the cinema **split screen** and the comics **layout**;

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="." %}

+ the differences between the **format** of the cinema **shot** and the one of the comics **panel**;

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="." %}

+ the respective procedures with which cinema and comics represent **voice**, **noise** and **music**;

{% include figure.html src="placeholder_00.png" caption="." %}

+ the respective procedures of **interpretation**.

### Hybrid Media Form

The consequences of the mid-1980s **digital revolution**[^digital-revolution], the birth of the **new digital media** and their characteristics, the **new possibilities** of **production** of the dynamic images given by the computer and the **Web** have been subsequently examined.

In the end a new **hybrid media form** that integrated both cinema and comics has been proposed and shown: Medlay.

Such a hybridization has been made possible by the mid-1980s digital revolution and by the **ever-growing**, **eclectic** and **inclusive Web** environment, which potentially serves as a **melting pot** for various old media forms and which nowadays has progressively become more and more important as a **distribution channel**.
