I am writing these notes to introduce and formalize a new concept for crafting multimedia artefacts on the Web — **Medlay** --- in hopes of providing some interesting **food for thought** and pushing the boundaries of the practice further.

They are a **work in progress**, thus they are potentially filled up with plenty of unfinished thoughts, grammar mistakes[^mistakes] and much more. If you feel you have something[^something] to say and/or spot something worth fixing, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ranbureand/medlay "Medlay on GitHub"): many many thanks!

[^mistakes]: And I bet there are plenty, since English it’s not my native language.

[^something]: Thoughts, critiques, suggestions, … are more than welcomed!
